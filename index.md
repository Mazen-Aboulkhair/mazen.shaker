## Usage of const keyword and "&" operator in c++

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Mazen-Aboulkhair/mazen.shaker/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### "const" Keyword 

-When a function is declared as const, it can be called on any type of object, const object as well as non-const objects.

-Whenever an object is declared as const, it needs to be initialized at the time of declaration. however, the object initialization while declaring is possible only with the help of constructors.

Following is a simple example of a const function:

```markdown
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class Test {
    int value;
 
public:
    Test(int v = 0) { value = v; }
 
    int getValue() const { return value; }
};
 
int main()
{
    Test t(20);
    cout << t.getValue();
    return 0;
}
```
Here the output will be:

```markdown
20
```
When a function is declared as const, it can be called on any type of object. Non-const functions can only be called by non-const objects. 

For example the following program has compiler errors:
```markdown
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class Test {
    int value;
public:
    Test(int v = 0) {value = v;}
    int getValue() {return value;}
};
 
int main() {
    const Test t;
    cout << t.getValue();
    return 0;
```

Here the output will be:

```markdown
passing 'const Test' as 'this' argument of 'int 
Test::getValue()' discards qualifiers
```

## Const Keyword With Pointer Variables:

Pointers can be declared with a const keyword. So, there are three possible ways to use a const keyword with a pointer, which are as follows:

When the pointer variable point to a const value:

Syntax: 
```markdown
const data_type* var_name;
```

Below is the C++ program to implement the above concept: 

```markdown
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    int x{ 10 };
    char y{ 'M' };
 
    const int* i = &x;
    const char* j = &y;
 
    // Value of x and y can be altered,
    // they are not constant variables
    x = 9;
    y = 'A';
 
    // Change of constant values because,
    // i and j are pointing to const-int
    // & const-char type value
    // *i = 6;
    // *j = 7;
 
    cout << *i << " " << *j;
}
```
Output: 
```markdown
9 A
```
### The "&" character in C++:

The "&" character can be used for 2 purposes which are mainly:

1-Take the address of a value
2-Declare a reference to a type

An example for 2: The parameter string& str is a reference to a string instance. This is not just limited to function signatures, it can occur in method bodies as well.

```markdown
void Example() {
  string s1 = "example";
  string& s2 = s1;  // s2 is now a reference to s1
}
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Mazen-Aboulkhair/mazen.shaker/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
